# MNZ-long-range-entanglement
Long-range quantum entanglement in dielectric mu-near-zero metamaterials

# Process
1. For given coupling parameters Concurrence.m yeilds the concurrence and G2.m yeilds the correlation function
2. Using the results from Concurrence.m the time evolution is modeled using NumericalTimeEvolution.nb
3. The combination of all compiled results are organized into a single figure using SingleFigure6Processingv2.m
